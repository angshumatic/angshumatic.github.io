# Closing the loop - Supply chains for circular economies


## Human Consumption: A Double-Edged Sword

> “You cannot control your population by force, but it can be distracted by consumption”
> \- Noam Chomsky

Consumption lies at the core of all human activity. From the prehistoric times where sources of food would drive human action and behaviour, up to the present day where the motivation to consume more and more drives individuals to greater aspirations and consequently towards heightened achievements, the need to consume has served as a prodigious source of motivation. The study of modern economics as envisioned by Adam Smith was grounded upon the assumption of monotonicity about human consumption and satisfaction; according to the indifference theory, any logical and self-serving human when offered a choice will welcome an increase in the size of a consumption bundle, independent of the existing bundle the consumer has at his or her disposal.

The nature of consumption and utility as perceived by humans has changed. We have moved on from craving more animal protein and enhanced mating opportunities, to needing greater social validation and a larger black automobile. But the nature of motivation rising from consumption has remained identical.


## Supply Chains in Action

Theoretically, a supply chain concerns itself with flows. For a business, flows constitute three dimensions – material, information, and finances. A utilitarian definition of supply chain would cover flow of goods and services and their intermediate transformations across the entire journey of value addition from their raw material form to the final products. Much of conventional supply chain management has dealt with means and methods to improve the efficiency of the processes which the product goes through.

For any line of business, effective management of the supply chain is crucial since the supply chain surplus generated eventually contributes to the operating profit driven through sales. A typical manufacturing-based supply chain consists of activities such as raw material procurement, industrial-scale production, transportation of materials, inventory management, demand forecasting, to name a few. While consumer-facing functions like Marketing and Sales ensure demand-side viability for an organization, the supply-side decisions and actions enabling smooth and profitable satisfaction of customer demands are looked after by the supply chain function.


## Peeking beyond the company gates

In the post-industrial revolution rush to improve supply chain performances, it was only the internal processes of value addition and support which gained traction. If it were outside the theoretical “boundaries” of an organization, the fate of a product was not within an organization's sphere of influence. Businesses were concerned with the efficiency of the processes taking place only within the ambit of their influence, i.e. within the gates of their factory. Any negative externalities associated to the manufacturing process were ignored as inconsequential. Particularly for a consumerism-driven post-World War II world, it was a completely natural and expected response to focus only on what drives the business, and not on what the business drives away.

It was in the early 1960’s when concerns were raised about industrial production, human consumption, and the fate of the environment in general. This in fact coincided with a rising global acceptance of the need to protect the environment from human activities, just a decade before the watershed moment of the Club of Rome report in 1972. British scientist and politician Harold Smith, in 1963, for the first time raised a question about accounting for cumulative energy emissions by the chemicals industries, which eventually led to the creation of a supremely important field of academic theory and practice – Life Cycle Analysis.


## Life Cycle Assessment

Performing a life cycle assessment, as the name suggests, involves looking beyond the walls of an organization. The “life” of a product absolutely does not begin or end within the factory premises. Every physical product or non-physical service is related to the earth’s natural resources in some form or the other. The location where an organization’s supply chain for the first time creates contact with the resource in its true and original form in nature is referred to as “cradle”. Similarly, even after a product has been manufactured, sold, and even used up by the user, its journey is not complete. Due to the indestructibility of mass and the limited lifespan of all industrial products, it also reaches its ultimate destination well beyond the boundaries of the company – known as the “grave”. Performing a conventional Life Cycle Analysis of a product involves accounting for the resources used and the processes followed at every step along the journey of a product from its cradle to its grave.

The purpose of an LCA analysis is to figure out the end-to-end impact of a product upon the ecosystem and environment which is inclusive of the journey from the cradle to its grave. The objective of this analysis is to create a quantitative metric about the environmental and ecological impact resulting from human consumption.


## From cradle onto cradle…

With exponential increase in human consumption, it was soon felt that restricting the impact assessment from cradle to grave is not sufficient to reduce the side-effects of environmental strain. This gave rise to the regenerative design process referred to as “Cradle to Cradle” or C2C. C2C is a biomimetic process of product design which ensures that products of one generation are responsible and directly contribute to the production of the next generation. In this way, it not only restricts the usage of fresh and untapped raw materials for the production process, but also greatly reduces the unused and often unaccounted for waste which remains within the ecosystem even after a product has been dismantled and sent to its grave. This modern and modified approach towards LCA is referred to as “Circular Economy”. The economy operates in loops, where one generation of products serves as the predecessors for an upcoming generation.

The onus obviously comes back to the supply chain for ensuring the success of this approach. The involvement starts right at the design phase. Firstly, functional and material properties are determined such that they are recyclable to their maximum extent for a subsequent batch of production. Subsequently, the design phase transfers the onus to the inbound logistics division, whose major role is to identify proper sourcing and procurement routes. After production and consumption, the third and most important level of the circular economy implementation starts, which involves tracing and monitoring of the products, recollection, sorting, and reuse. The loop is hence closed.


## The Path Ahead

Adoption of a paradigm shifting technique is never simple, and as is the norm, the primary consideration and roadblock in the implementation becomes the cost aspect. While most industries are used to operating and functioning along certain set guidelines and pre-set methods, changing the entire supply chain to accommodate a circular economy implementation is a major administrative and financial roadblock. In all three phases discussed before, the processes and designs need to undergo a sea change. R&D expenses are incurred, new and dependable suppliers need to be onboarded, the procurement team needs greater investment. To align with regulatory norms on LCA and circular economy, ecolabels and green ecological certifications need to be obtained, which prove to be an administrative task requiring effort and time. The biggest modification takes place in the final step of the implementation, which includes product tracing and sorting. Most modern supply chains retain minimal contact or information about their products once a consumer purchases it. Implementing a circular economy involves keeping track of consumers and eventually recollecting the discarded products once their useful lifespan ends, so that it can be recycled for the next generation of products.

The measures and implications, however, are positive. Technology and engineering have enabled a convenient solution to many of these roadblocks. With more and more global and governmental emphasis upon green supply chains and the 3R’s of Reduce-Reuse-Recycle, it is now much easier and less costly to modify a supply chain in accordance to sustainable C2C policies. Particularly for electronic consumer durables, a huge source of non-degradable waste at landfills across the world, product tracing through cloud-based tools and consumer tracking is imminently possible. Through online data repositories and incentivizing customers to participate in efforts to close the consumption loop, the involvement of the consumers in the cycle can also be increased.


## Epilogue

According to a Forbes report, the average American family purchases $1700 worth of clothes annually; the number is worth more than a month of unemployment benefits doled out by the US Labour Department. In India, about half the population spends between ₹500 to ₹2,500 every month on clothes. While the US apparel industry had grown to be $12 billion in 2015, this also results in 24 billion pounds worth clothes and apparels making their way into US landfills and dumping sites every year. These numbers, startling though they are, are merely representative. The onus is on everyone to get these numbers down and reduce the quantum of waste we are generating every day.
