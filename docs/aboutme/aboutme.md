My current research is on location optimization of discretionary service facilities with stochastic congestion contraints in urban transportation networks using mixed integer linear programming tools.

<span style="font-family:Garamond;">
Beyond my professional duties, I write on my [personal blog](https://angshumatic.github.io/archive.html) on matters that matter to me, contribute to a bilingual fiction-blog at [Aweবাক জলpun](https://awebaakjolpun.wordpress.com/), and post intermittently on Instagram as [@angshumatic](https://www.instagram.com/angshumatic/). Once I have turned my devices off, I read and write in two languages, and play two western classical instruments. Bengali literature keeps me happy, chess allows me to rewind, and math memes entertain me.<br/>
