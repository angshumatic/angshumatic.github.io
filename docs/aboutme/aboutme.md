I am a consultant by profession, currently working with the Advisory team at [PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India](https://www.pwc.in/). I am a business graduate from [XLRI Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur](https://www.xlri.ac.in/), with a major in Decision Sciences & Operations. Prior to that, I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Jadavpur University, Kolkata](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), after which I worked as an Operations Engineer with [The Linde Group](https://www.linde.in/en/index.html) in the chemicals manufacturing industry.<br/>

  In my current role, I employ and manage technology in its various dispositions to make tasks simpler and lives easier for businesses and their employees. My academic interests lie in the fields of decision sciences, operations, statistics, and econometrics, and my research experience is in the area of statistical inference and quality management. Do drop an email if you want to collaborate or discuss.<br/>

<span style="font-family:Garamond;">
Beyond my professional duties, I write on my [personal blog](https://angshumatic.github.io/archive.html) on matters that matter to me, contribute to a bilingual fiction-blog at [Aweবাক জলpun](https://awebaakjolpun.wordpress.com/), and post intermittently on Instagram as [@angshumatic](https://www.instagram.com/angshumatic/).<br/>

  Once I have turned my devices off, I read and write in two languages, and play two western classical instruments. Bengali literature keeps me happy, chess allows me to rewind, math memes entertain me, and my Spotify playlists are usually liked by those who share my palate and disposition.<br/>
