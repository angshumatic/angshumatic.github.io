I am a Research Associate at the Centre for Transportation and Logistics (CTL) at Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA). I am currently working on a discretionary service facility location problem with stochastic demand, for optimized allocation of EV charging facilities under Prof. Prahalad Venkateshan at IIMA.<br/>
  
Prior to this, I have completed my PGDM in Business Management from [XLRI Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur](https://www.xlri.ac.in/) in 2021 with a major in Decision Sciences & Operations, and my BE (Mech) from [Jadavpur University, Kolkata](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/) in 2018. I have previously worked with [PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India](https://www.pwc.in/) as a Technology Consultant, and as an Operations Engineer with [The Linde Group](https://www.linde.in/en/index.html) in the chemicals manufacturing industry.<br/>

Beyond my professional duties, I write on my [personal blog](https://angshumatic.github.io/archive.html) on matters that matter to me, contribute to a bilingual fiction-blog at [Aweবাক জলpun](https://awebaakjolpun.wordpress.com/), and post intermittently on Instagram as [@angshumatic](https://www.instagram.com/angshumatic/).<br/>

  Once I have turned my devices off, I read and write in two languages, and play two western classical instruments. Bengali literature keeps me happy, chess allows me to rewind, math memes entertain me, and my Spotify playlists are usually liked by those who share my palate and disposition.<br/>
