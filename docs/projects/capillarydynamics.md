Experiments performed on channels of poly-dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) show observable and repeatable patterns in the behavior of fluids. The soft PDMS material used to fabricate the microcapillaries are characterized for their physical properties and their influence on the capillary rise phenomenon is analyzed. The dynamics of meniscus rise are observed and validated against established dynamic models of capillarity. Possibility of oscillations at the end of capillary rise period is investigated, and existing theoretical models explaining the occurrence of oscillations are validated. Effect of deformability on the liquid column rise is investigated and prospective applications are explored. | [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBnW5xJDLebwWYOcnDTsXPgG7AtgPJQp/view?usp=sharing)</span>
