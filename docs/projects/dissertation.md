However, unilateral development and growth in the industry comes with its own disadvantages and disutilities upon the environment and society. Developments in sustainability since mid-20th century have brought focus on the need to push the boundaries of growth in a controlled and sustainable manner. In this work, through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) review and using a Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework for sustainability, the past and present industrial practices of steelmaking in India are reviewed. Using an Environment-Society-Governance framework (ESG), six industrial risks falling under three categories are critically examined. | [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SdgFJj9BdUdGbPTpntQTjGf_pzMKuviW/view?usp=sharing)</span>
