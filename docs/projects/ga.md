A new program is developed from first principles in MATLAB environment. The code is tested against standardized functions and benchmarking is performed to validate its performance against results reproduced in existing literature. The algorithm is then run over real process performance data obtained from mechanical milling operation, and the optimum input parameters under given constraints required for achieving minimum surface roughness are determined. | [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NLoW8r8a_-SmLYdVhczwRz4kUO1cv8c1/view?usp=sharing)</span>
