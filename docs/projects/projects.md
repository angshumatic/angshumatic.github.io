- **Applications of Lattice Boltzmann Method in Dynamic Modelling of Fluid Flows**<br/>
**Advisor**: Prof. Himadri Chattopadhyay, *Professor*, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Jadavpur University<br/>
`January 2018 - April 2018`<br/>
<span style="font-family:Garamond;">The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is an alternative to the commonly used discretization principle for solving the Navier Stokes equation in fluid mechanics. It deals with the properties of fluid particles on a micro scale and subsequently uses them to generate the model of the entire flow domain on a macro scale. A detailed study is performed on the LBM model and its underlying principles. A program for its execution is written in MATLAB environment. Simulations are run on a simple geometry involving steady flow through a circular pipe. The results obtained are analysed and verified against the expected results given by mathematical models and actual experimentation. | [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xiDIaSVU2Pi2sqhqKRdWWpbW_MG6qG9z/view?usp=sharing)</span>


- **Genetic Algorithm Based Optimization of Machining Parameters**<br/>
**Advisor**: Prof. Tapan Kumar Barman, *Professor*, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Jadavpur University<br/>
`July 2017 - November 2017`<br/>
<span style="font-family:Garamond;">This project examines and formulates a mechanism to optimize a given process output using the technique of Genetic Algorithm. A new program is developed from first principles in MATLAB environment. The code is tested against standardized functions and benchmarking is performed to validate its performance against results reproduced in existing literature. The algorithm is then run over real process performance data obtained from mechanical milling operation, and the optimum input parameters under given constraints required for achieving minimum surface roughness are determined. | [Project Report]((https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NLoW8r8a_-SmLYdVhczwRz4kUO1cv8c1/view?usp=sharing))</span>



- **Capillary Dynamics in Soft Deformable Microchannels**<br/>
**Advisor**: Prof. Suman Chakraborty, *Professor*, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur<br/>
`May 2017 - July 2017`<br/>
<span style="font-family:Garamond;">In this study, an overview of the phenomenon of capillary rise in microchannels of high deformability is presented. Experiments performed on channels of poly-dimethyl siloxane (PDMS) show observable and repeatable patterns in the behavior of fluids. The soft PDMS material used to fabricate the microcapillaries are characterized for their physical properties and their influence on the capillary rise phenomenon is analyzed. The dynamics of meniscus rise are observed and validated against established dynamic models of capillarity. Possibility of oscillations at the end of capillary rise period is investigated, and existing theoretical models explaining the occurrence of oscillations are validated. Effect of deformability on the liquid column rise is investigated and prospective applications are explored. | [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBnW5xJDLebwWYOcnDTsXPgG7AtgPJQp/view?usp=sharing)</span>
