- `2018` **Applications of Lattice Boltzmann Method in Dynamic Modelling of Fluid Flows**<br/>
Advisor: **Prof. Himadri Chattopadhyay**, *Professor*, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Jadavpur University<br/>
<span style="font-family:Garamond;">The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is an alternative to the commonly used discretization principle for solving the Navier Stokes equation in fluid mechanics. It deals with the properties of fluid particles on a micro scale and subsequently uses them to generate the model of the entire flow domain on a macro scale. A detailed study is performed on the LBM model and its underlying principles. A program for its execution is written in MATLAB environment. Simulations are run on a simple geometry involving steady flow through a circular pipe. The results obtained are analysed and verified against the expected results given by mathematical models and actual experimentation. | [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xiDIaSVU2Pi2sqhqKRdWWpbW_MG6qG9z/view?usp=sharing)</span>
