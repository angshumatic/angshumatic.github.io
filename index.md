Hello, and welcome to my world. My name is Angshuman.

I am a consultant by profession, currently working with the Advisory team at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India. I am a business graduate from XLRI Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, and prior to that a mechanical engineer from Jadavpur University, Kolkata. My interests are profound in the fields of statistics, decision sciences, econometrics, and operations. More about my academic work on [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n_LYBhEAAAAJ).

Personally, I am a write in two languages and play western classical music. Bengali literature keeps me happy, chess allows me to rewind, and my Spotify playlists mostly very likeable.

I present my opinions on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angshumanpal11/), contribute in English to a bilingual fiction-blog at [Aweবাক জলpun](https://awebaakjolpun.wordpress.com/), and post intermittently on Instagram from [@angshumatic](https://www.instagram.com/angshumatic/).
