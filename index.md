Hello, and welcome to my world. My name is Angshuman, and I live in Kolkata, India.

I am a consultant by profession, currently working with the Advisory team at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India. I am a business graduate from XLRI Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur with a major in Decision Sciences & Operations. I also have a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, and a year of experience as an Operations Engineer with Linde India Ltd within the chemicals manufacturing industry.

At work, I employ and manage technology in its various dispositions to make tasks simpler and lives easier for businesses and their employees. While technology excites me, mathematics on the other hand intrigues me. My academic interests are spread out over the fields of statistics, decision sciences, econometrics, and operations. I strongly believe in academic research in management sciences and the STEM fields which contributes to lasting change in society, in some form or the other. Do drop an email if you want to collaborate or discuss. More about my academic work on [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n_LYBhEAAAAJ).

"Work" rarely restricts itself to narrow definitions. Beyond my professional duties, I also devote a few hours every week to pro-bono social impact creation as a Business Development Manager with [Impact Consulting, Kolkata](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ic-kolkata/), and when time permits I teach myself scientific programming. I share my opinions on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angshumanpal11/), contribute in English to a bilingual fiction-blog at [Aweবাক জলpun](https://awebaakjolpun.wordpress.com/), and post intermittently on Instagram from [@angshumatic](https://www.instagram.com/angshumatic/).

Once I have turned my devices off, I write for myself and for the world in two languages, and play two western classical instruments. Bengali literature keeps me happy, chess allows me to rewind, intelligent math memes hugely entertain me, my voice on social change is normally quite audible, and my Spotify playlists are liked by those who share my palate and disposition.

Have a great day!
