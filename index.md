  Hello, and welcome to my world. My name is Angshuman, and I live in Kolkata, India.<br/>
  Here I accommodate the new ideas which pass me by, by asking the old ones to shift one room each.

<span style="font-family:Garamond;">
  I am a consultant by profession, currently working with the Advisory team at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) India. I am a business graduate from XLRI Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, with a major in Decision Sciences & Operations. I also have a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, and have priorly worked as an Operations Engineer with The Linde Group, in the chemicals manufacturing industry.<br/>

<span style="font-family:Garamond;">
  In my current role, I employ and manage technology in its various dispositions to make tasks simpler and lives easier for businesses and their employees. While technology excites me, mathematics on the other hand intrigues me. My academic interests are spread out over the fields of statistics, decision sciences, econometrics, and operations. I strongly believe in the potential of academic research in management sciences and STEM to contribute to lasting change in society. Do drop an email if you want to collaborate or discuss.<br/>

Work rarely restricts itself to narrow definitions. Beyond my professional duties, I devote a few hours every week to pro-bono social impact creation as a Business Development Manager with [Impact Consulting, Kolkata](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ic-kolkata/), and when time permits I teach myself scientific coding using mathematical programming tools. I run my [personal blog](https://angshumatic.github.io/archive.html) on matters that matter to me, contribute in English to a bilingual fiction-blog at [Aweবাক জলpun](https://awebaakjolpun.wordpress.com/), and post intermittently on Instagram as [@angshumatic](https://www.instagram.com/angshumatic/).<br/>
</span>

<span style="font-family:Garamond;">
  Once I have turned my devices off, I write for myself and for the world in two languages, and play two western classical instruments. Bengali literature keeps me happy, chess allows me to rewind, smart math memes entertain me, my voice on social change is normally quite audible, and my Spotify playlists are usually liked by those who share my palate and disposition.<br/>

  Have a great day!<br/>
